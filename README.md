# Card Image Classifier
I wanted to learn pytorch and image classification
I followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHL5STNJKag

I added my own methods and tweaked it to my liking

## Give it a go!
```bash
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
Run main.py
```bash
python .\main.py
```
